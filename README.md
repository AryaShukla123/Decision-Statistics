## Overview
**Decision-Statistics** is a professional-grade analytical engine designed to bridge the gap between raw data collection and academic-grade inference. Built with Python and Streamlit, it automates distribution selection and provides interactive visual feedback for hypothesis testing and bivariate relationships.

## Key Features

### 1. Univariate Inference (One-Variable)
* **Smart Distribution Selection:** Automatically toggles between **Z-Tests** and **Student’s T-Tests** based on sample size ($n$).
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Real-time P-value calculation against user-defined null hypotheses ($\mu_0$) with clear significance indicators.
* **N-Optimizer:** A power analysis tool to determine the required sample size for a target Margin of Error (MoE), helping plan future data collection.

### 2. Bivariate Analytics (Two-Variable)
* **Linear Regression:** Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) modeling including Slope, Intercept, and Standard Error.
* **Predictive Engine:** Integrated forecasting tool that uses the derived regression equation to predict $Y$ values based on $X$ inputs.
* **Statistical Metrics:** Instant calculation of Pearson Correlation ($r$) and the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$).

### 3. Advanced Visualizations
* **Confidence Interval Plots:** Interactive Plotly charts visualizing the range of uncertainty.
* **Residual Analysis:** Dedicated charts to validate linear regression assumptions by checking for randomness in errors.
* **Sample Size Curves:** Visualizing the law of diminishing returns in data collection.

### 4. Data Portability
* **Report Generation:** One-click export of statistical findings into a clean text-based report for documentation and sharing.
